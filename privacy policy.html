    <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

    <p>I, Sairam Kawade, the owner and administrator of a personal portfolio website, am committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of all users who visit and interact with my site. This letter serves as the official Privacy Policy for the website, effective from 26 July 2025.</p>

    <p>The portfolio website is designed to present my personal projects, academic background, and professional skills. Visitors may freely browse the site without providing any personal information. However, if users choose to contact me through a form or email link, limited personal information such as their name, email address, and message content may be voluntarily submitted. This data is used solely to respond to user inquiries and is never sold, shared, or used for unsolicited marketing.</p>

    <p>The website may also collect non-personal information automatically, including IP addresses, device types, browser versions, and usage data such as pages visited and time spent on the site. This information is processed anonymously using analytics tools like Google Analytics to evaluate and improve the functionality and performance of the website. Cookies may be employed for essential website operations and anonymous statistical tracking, but no behavioral advertising or profiling is conducted.</p>

    <p>All data is protected using standard technical safeguards, such as SSL encryption (HTTPS). Any user-submitted information is stored securely and retained only as long as necessary for its original purpose. The website does not collect or store sensitive personal, financial, or government-issued identification data.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the site may contain external links to third-party platforms such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and other embedded media. These third-party websites are governed by their own privacy policies, and users are encouraged to review them separately. The portfolio website is not intended for children under the age of 13, and no information is knowingly collected from minors.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, and any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of the document. Continued use of the website implies acceptance of the most current version of the policy.</p>

    <p>For any questions, concerns, or requests related to data handling or privacy, users may contact me directly at <a href="mailto:kawadesairam@gmail.com">kawadesairam@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br />
